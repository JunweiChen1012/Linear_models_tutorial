In this exercise we will generate some data from the normal distribution with mean 1 and standard  deviation 1. 
We then transform the data as outlined in the Data Simulation section and proceed to investigate whether the mean of the true data generating process 
is greater than 0. We will then discuss some of the issues brought about by the data transformations and what steps we can put in place to flag some 
these issues during data analysis.
